* Create and render at least one view using a view template and template engine. This can be a custom template engine or a third-party engine.
* If you are stuck on how to approach this, think about ways you could render the current state of your API's data for easy viewing.
* Use simple CSS to style the rendered views. Note: This is not a test of design; it is a test of serving static files using Express. The CSS can be very simple.
* Include a form within a rendered view that allows for interaction with your RESTful API.
